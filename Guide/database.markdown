## Introduction

IHP provides a few basic functions to access the database. On top of Postgres SQL, we try to provide a thin layer to make it easy to do all the common tasks your web application usually does.

The only supported database platform is Postgres. Focusing on Postgres allows us to better integrate advanced Postgres-specific solutions into your application.

In development, you do not need to set up anything to use Postgres. The built-in development server automatically starts a Postgres instance to work with your application. The built-in development Postgres server is only listening on a Unix socket and is not available via TCP.

When the development server is running, you can connect to it via `postgresql:///app?host=YOUR_PROJECT_DIRECTORY/build/db` with your favorite database tool. When inside the project directory you can also use `make psql` to open a Postgres REPL connected to the development database (named `app`), or start `psql` by pointing at the local sockets file `psql --host=/PATH/TO/PROJECT/DIRECTORY/build/db app`. The web interface of the development server also has a GUI-based database editor (like phpmyadmin) at [http://localhost:8001/ShowDatabase](http://localhost:8001/ShowDatabase).

Haskell data structures and types are generated automatically based on your database schema.

### Schema.sql

Once you have created your project, the first step is to define a database schema. The database schema is a SQL file with a lot of `CREATE TABLE ...` statements. You can find it at `Application/Schema.sql`.

In a new project, this file will be empty. The [`uuid-ossp`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/uuid-ossp.html) extension is automatically enabled for the database by IHP.

To define your database schema add your `CREATE TABLE ...` statements to the `Schema.sql`. For a users table this can look like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    firstname TEXT NOT NULL,
    lastname TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

Haskell data structures and types are automatically generated from the `Schema.sql` file. They are re-generated on every file change of the `Schema.sql`. We use the well-known [`postgresql-simple`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/postgresql-simple) Haskell library to connect to the database.

### Schema Designer

Because the SQL syntax is sometimes hard to remember, the framework provides a GUI-based database editor called IHP Schema Designer. You can find the Schema Designer at `http://localhost:8001/Tables`.

![The Schema Designer in Visual Mode](images/database/schema-designer-visual.png)

Keep in mind that the Schema Editor also only modifies the `Schema.sql`. This works by parsing the SQL DDL-statements and applying transformations on the AST, compiling and writing it back to `Schema.sql`. When there is a syntax error in the `Schema.sql` file the visual mode will be unavailable and you have to work with the code editor to fix the problem.

You can add tables, columns, foreign key constraints, and enums. You can also edit these objects by right-clicking them. New tables have an `id` column by default. Lots of opinionated short-cuts for rapid application development like automatically offering to add foreign key constraints are built-in.

![An example of using the context menu for editing a table](images/database/schema-designer-context-menu.png)

When the Visual Editor is not powerful enough, just switch back to the code editor. For convenience, the Schema Designer also allows you to toggle to the Code Editor inside the web browser:

### Push to DB

After we have added a few data structures to our `Schema.sql`, our running Postgres database is still empty. This is because we still need to import our database schema into the database.

**In the Schema Designer:** Click on `Push to DB`:

![Push to DB Button](images/database/schema-designer-push-to-db.png)

**In the command line:** Run `make db` while the server is running.

This will delete and re-create the current database and import the `Schema.sql`. After importing the Schema, it will also import the `Application/Fixtures.sql` which is used for pre-populating the empty database with some data. It's equivalent to running `psql < Schema.sql; psql < Fixtures.sql` inside an empty database.

When the development server is started the first time, the `Schema.sql` and `Fixtures.sql` are automatically imported.

### Fixtures.sql

The `Fixtures.sql` includes a lot of `INSERT INTO` statements to pre-fill your database once the schema has been created.

You can manually add `INSERT INTO` statements to this file. You can also _migrate_ your fixtures by just making the required changes to this SQL file.

You can dump your current database state into the `Fixtures.sql` by running `make dumpdb`. This way you can regularly commit the database state to git, so other developers have the same data inside their local development database as you have.

### Update DB

You can also update the database while keeping its contents.

**In the Schema Designer:** Click on `Update DB`:

![Push to DB Button](images/database/schema-designer-push-to-db.png)

**In the command line:** Run `make dumpdb` and after that `make db`.

When dumping the database into the `Fixtures.sql` first and then rebuilding the database with the dump, the contents will be kept when changing the schema.

## Haskell Bindings

### Model Context

In a pure functional programming language like Haskell, we need to pass the database connection to all functions which need to access the database. We use an implicit parameter `?modelContext :: ModelContext` to pass around the database connection without always specifying it. The `ModelContext` data structure is basically just a wrapper around the actual database connection.

An implicit parameter is a parameter which is automatically passed to certain functions, it just needs to be available in the current scope.

This means that all functions which are running database queries will need to be called from a function which has this implicit parameter in scope. A function doing something with the database, will always have a type signature specifying that it requires the `?modelContext` to be available, like this:

```haskell
myFunc :: (?modelContext :: ModelContext) => IO SomeResult
```

All controller actions already have `?modelContext` in scope and thus can run database queries. Other application entry-points, like e.g. Scripts, also have this in scope.

This also means, that when a function does not specify that it depends on the database connection in its type signature (like `?modelContext :: ModelContext => ..`), you can be sure that it's not doing any database operations.

### Haskell Data Structures

For every table in the `Schema.sql` a corresponding data structure will be generated on the Haskell side. For example, given a table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    firstname TEXT NOT NULL,
    lastname TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

The generated Haskell data structure for this table will look like this:

```haskell
data User = User
    { id :: Id User
    , firstname :: Text
    , lastname :: Text
    }
```

The `id` field type `Id User` is basically just a wrapper around `UUID` for type-safety reasons. All database field names are mapped from `under_score` to `camelCase` on the Haskell side.

When a SQL field can be `NULL`, the Haskell field type will be contained in `Maybe`.

In the Schema Designer, you can take a look at the generated Haskell code by right-clicking the table and clicking `Show Generated Haskell Code`.

## Retrieving Records

### Querying Records

You can retrieve all records of a table using `query`

```haskell
do
    users <- query @User |> fetch
    forEach users \user -> do
        putStrLn (get #name user)
```

This will run a `SELECT * FROM users` query and put a list of `User` structures.

### Fetching a single record

When you have the id of a record, you can also use `fetch` to get it from the database:

```haskell
do
    let userId :: Id User = ...
    user <- fetch userId
    putStrLn (get #name user)
```

This will run the SQL query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ... LIMIT 1`.

`fetch` knows a single entity will be returned for the id, so instead of a list of users, a single user will be returned. In case the entity is not found, an exception is thrown. Use `fetchOrNothing` to get `Nothing` instead of an exception when no result is found

### Fetching a list of ids

When have you a list of ids of a single record type, you can also just `fetch` them:

```haskell
do
    let userIds :: [Id User] = ...
    users <- fetch userIds
```

This will run the SQL query `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id IN (...)`. The results in `users` have type `[User]`.

### Fetching a `Maybe (Id record)`

Sometimes you have an optional id field, like e.g. when having a database schema like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    assigned_user_id UUID
);
```

In this case the field `assigned_user_id` can be null. In our action we want to fetch user when it's not null, and return `Nothing` otherwise:

```haskell
action ShowTask { taskId } = do
    task <- fetch taskId
    assignedUser <- case get #assignedUserId task of
            Just userId -> do
                user <- fetch userId
                pure (Just user)
            Nothing -> pure Nothing
```

This contains a lot of boilerplate for wrapping and unwrapping the `Maybe` value. Therefore you can just call `fetchOneOrNothing` directly on the `Maybe (Id User)` value:

```haskell
action ShowTask { taskId } = do
    task <- fetch taskId
    assignedUser <- fetchOneOrNothing (get #assignedUserId task)
```

### Fetching `n` records (LIMIT)

Use `limit` to query only up to `n` records from a table:

```haskell
do
    users <- query @User
        |> orderBy #firstname
        |> limit 10
        |> fetch
```

This will run a `SELECT * FROM users ORDER BY firstname LIMIT 10` query and will return the first 10 users ordered by their `firstname`.

When you are only interested in the first result you can also use `fetchOne` as a shortcut for `|> limit 1`:

```haskell
do
    firstUser <- query @User
        |> orderBy #firstname
        |> fetchOne
```

### Skipping `n` records (OFFSET)

Use `offset` to skip `n` records from a table:

```haskell
do
    users <- query @User
        |> orderBy #firstname
        |> offset 10
        |> fetch
```

This is most often used together with `limit` to implement paging.

### Counting records (COUNT queries)

You can use `fetchCount` instead of `fetch` to get the count of records matching the query:

```haskell
do
    activeUsersCount :: Int <- query @User
        |> filterWhere (#isActive, True)
        |> fetchCount

    -- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE is_active = 1
```

### Fetching distinct records

Use `distinct` to fetch distinct records.

```haskell
do
    posts <- query @Post
        |> distinct
        |> fetch
```

Or `distinctOn #tableField` to fetch distinct records based on the `#tableField` value.

```haskell
do
    users <- query @User
        |> distinctBy #fullName
        |> fetch
```

## Raw SQL Queries

Use the function `sqlQuery` to run a raw SQL query.

```haskell
do
    result <- sqlQuery "SELECT * FROM projects WHERE id = ?" (Only id)
```

You might need to specify the expected result type, as type inference might not be able to guess it.

```haskell
do
    result :: [Project] <- sqlQuery "SELECT * FROM projects WHERE id = ?" (Only id)
```

### Scalar Results

The `sqlQuery` function always returns a list of rows as the result. When the result of your query is a single value (such as an integer or string) use `sqlQueryScalar`:

```haskell
do
    count :: Int <- sqlQueryScalar "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects" ()

    randomString :: Text <- sqlQueryScalar "SELECT md5(random()::text)" ()
```

## Create

### Creating a single record

To insert a record into the database, call `newRecord` to get an empty record value:

```haskell
do
    let user = newRecord @User
    -- user = User { id = 0000-0000-0000-0000, firstname = "", lastname = "" }
```

The `newRecord` function does not insert the record, it just returns a new empty data structure we can fill with values and then insert into the database.

We can use `set` to fill in attributes:

```haskell
do
    let user = newRecord @User
            |> set #firstname "Max"
            |> set #lastname "Mustermann"

    -- user = User { id = 0000-0000-0000-0000, firstname = "Max", lastname = "Mustermann" }
```

We use `createRecord` to insert the above record into the `users` table:

```haskell
do
    let user = newRecord @User
            |> set #firstname "Max"
            |> set #lastname "Mustermann"

    -- user = User { id = 0000-0000-0000-0000, firstname = "Max", lastname = "Mustermann" }

    insertedUser <- user |> createRecord
    -- This will run INSERT INTO users (id, firstname, lastname) VALUES (DEFAULT, "Max", "Mustermann");
    -- insertedUser = User { id = cf633b17-c409-4df5-a2fc-8c3b3d6c2ea7, firstname = "Max", lastname = "Mustermann" }
```

This can also be rewritten in a more compact form:

```haskell
do
    user <- newRecord @User
            |> set #firstname "Max"
            |> set #lastname "Mustermann"
            |> createRecord
    -- user = User { id = "cf633b17-c409-4df5-a2fc-8c3b3d6c2ea7", firstname = "Max", lastname = "Mustermann" }
```

### Creating many records

You can use `createMany` to insert multiple records with a single `INSERT` statement:

```haskell
do
    let usersToBeInserted [ newRecord @User, newRecord @User, ... ]
    users <- createMany usersToBeInserted
```

This will run:

```sql
INSERT INTO users (id, firstname, lastname)
    VALUES (DEFAULT, "", ""), (DEFAULT, "", "") , (DEFAULT, "", "") ... ;
```

## Update

The function `updateRecord` runs an `UPDATE` query for a specific record:

```haskell
do
    user <- fetch ("cf633b17-c409-4df5-a2fc-8c3b3d6c2ea7" :: Id User)
    user
        |> set #lastname "Tester"
        |> updateRecord
```

This will set the `lastname` of user `cf633b17-c409-4df5-a2fc-8c3b3d6c2ea7` to `Tester` and run an `UPDATE` query to persist that:

```sql
UPDATE users SET firstname = firstname, lastname = "Tester" WHERE id = "cf633b17-c409-4df5-a2fc-8c3b3d6c2ea7"
```

The `UPDATE` query will only update columns that have been changed using `|> set #someField someValue` on the record.

## Delete

### Deleting a single record

Use `deleteRecord` to run a simple `DELETE` query:

```haskell
do
    user <- fetch ("cf633b17-c409-4df5-a2fc-8c3b3d6c2ea7" :: Id User)
    deleteRecord user
```

This will execute:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = "cf633b17-c409-4df5-a2fc-8c3b3d6c2ea7"
```

### Deleting many records

Use `deleteRecords` to run a `DELETE` query for multiple records:

```haskell
do
    users :: [User] <- ...
    deleteRecords users
```

This will execute:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id IN (...)
```

### Deleting all records

Use `deleteAll` to run a `DELETE` query for all rows in a table:

```haskell
do
    deleteAll @User
```

This will execute:

```sql
DELETE FROM users
```

## Enums

It's possible to define and use custom enum types with IHP. An enum can be created using the Schema Designer. The process is pretty much the same as when creating a table.

### Adding enums via the Schema Designer

Open the Schema Designer, right-click into the `Objects` Pane, and then select `Add Enum`:

![](images/database/schema-designer-context-menu.png)

You have to give a name to your enum type. The name should be in plural form, like with table names. E.g. we could name our enum `colors`.

Next, add the enum values by right-clicking into the `Values` pane and click on `Add Value`. Here we could add values such as `red`, `blue` and `yellow`.

### Adding enums via SQL

Instead of using the Schema Designer, you can also just add the required SQL statement manually into `Application/Schema.hs`:

```sql
CREATE TYPE colors AS ENUM ('blue', 'red', 'yellow');
```

### Using enums in the Haskell Code

The above `colors` example will allow us to access the enum like this:

```haskell
let blue :: Colors = Blue
let red :: Colors = Red
let yellow :: Colors = Yellow
```

You can use the enum as a field type for another record. E.g. we can have `posts` table and there give each post a color:

```sql
CREATE TABLE posts (
    id UUID DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4() PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL,
    body TEXT NOT NULL,
    color colors
);
```

You can use `fill` even with custom enums:

```haskell
    action CreatePostAction = do
        let post = newRecord @Post
        post
            |> fill @["body", "color"]
            |> ifValid \case
                Left post -> render NewView { .. }
                Right post -> do
                    post <- post |> createRecord
                    setSuccessMessage "Post created"
                    redirectTo PostsAction
```

In your views, use `inputValue` to get a textual representation for your enum which works with `fill`:

```html
[hsx|
<input type="text" value="{inputValue" Blue} />
|]
```
